Directory Structure





1.Run the command 'csh' to change the shell to cshell  

2.Untar the package.
	tar -xvzf as1.tgz
	This will create a directory named "as1"
 
2.Create a directory for logfiles at any location.Let this be named as 'log'
  Use the command 
	mkdir log	
	cd log
  Run the command 'pwd'. This will give the absolute path for log directory. Note it down.	

3.Set following environment variables in ~/.cshrc file

	AS1 : Absolute path of as1 folder
	PFILES : Absolute path of paramfiles folder
	PATH : Absolute path of bin directory where all executables are placed 
	GLOG_log_dir : Absolute path of the directory where all logfiles need to be generated
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH : Path to shared libraries 

Add following lines to ~/.cshrc file
	setenv AS1 <path to as1 directory>
	setenv PFILES $AS1/uvit/paramfiles
	setenv PATH $AS1/uvit/bin:$PATH
	setenv GLOG_log_dir <path to log directory>
	
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $AS1/uvit/lib
	xhost +
	limit stacksize unlimited
	limit coredumpsize unlimited
4. tar file creation time must be less than the system time.

5. Run the following commands
	source ~/.cshrc
	cd $AS1
	./InstallLibs
		$AS1 folder must contain include/, lib/, share/ and bin/ directories
	cd uvit
	make
	source ~/.cshrc
6. Now you can use the uvit software modules
